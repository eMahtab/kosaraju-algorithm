# Kosaraju's Algorithm : O(V+E)

Kosaraju's algorithm is used to find the strongly connected components(SCC) in a graph.

It makes use of the fact that the transpose graph (the same graph with the direction of every edge reversed) has exactly the same strongly connected components as the original graph.

## Strongly Connected Component :
If we can reach every vertex of a component from every other vertex in that component then it is called a Strongly Connected Component (SCC).
